The use of average pooling before
the classifier is based on [12], although our implementation
has an additional linear layer. The linear layer enables us to
easily adapt our networks to other label sets, however it is
used mostly for convenience and we do not expect it to have
a major effect. We found that a move from fully connected
layers to average pooling improved the top-1 accuracy by
about 0.6%, however the use of dropout remained essential
even after removing the fully connected layers.
