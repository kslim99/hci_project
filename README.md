# LAMP (Learn Animated ML models with Papers)

### About
Hello! We are building a web page with interactive features that help you understand the basics of CNN models as a term project for 'Human Computer Interaction' course.
Our aim is to help beginners in ML to easily read papers and save their time spent for searching extra explanations on various media.

### Web Page
We are using github page for our website.
Check out https://kslim99.github.io/hci_project/lamp.html to see how LAMP works! (We recommend you use Chorme as a browser.)
According to your screen size, some features might overlap with each other. In this case, try `ctrl + scroll down` so that you can set the zoom attribute of your browser to 90% or below.
(It's still in the process of development. So some features may not be implemented yet.)
